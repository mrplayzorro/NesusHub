# NesusHub

Fixed lag, silent aim working! More features, walkspeed wont work in some games. Added server hop, only works in arsenal tho.

Help is always accepted!

New logo and server https://discord.gg/fH8Nes5xrA (Not finished)

For any bugs report them in the server and I will try to fix.

Loadstring changed, check the new in the "loadstring" thing.

# Is it safe

Well no shit it is

# Usage

Either use the loadstring or the normal script, go in your injector and paste it in there

# Wtf is an executor / injector

It's a thing that makes you exploit (wow) you paste the script and tap inject or attach

# Can I have some safe exploits

Sure m8

# Wtf is nexus hub and why tf would I use it

Im glad you asked, Nexus Hub is an Hub (obv) for arsenal and Counter blox. Im planning to make it universal soon. After you inject you get this cool gui, you go to ESP and Silent aim and you are much better
